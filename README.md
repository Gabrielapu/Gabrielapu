ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gabriel

I have been working for 3.5 years with VueJs 2 & 3, NuxtJS, GIT, CSS, HTML, TailwindCSS and some months with Angular 2+. 
Also, I've produced responsive designs following Figma views created by designer.
The tasks that I have been done are related to CRUDs, Maps with Leaflet library, Gantt chart.

I love to make reausable code, clean code and work with DRY pattern.
